//WordPress Theme Customization:Let's say you want to customize the header of your WordPress theme by adding a custom background color.Create a child theme if you haven't already.

/* style.css in child theme */
header {
    background-color: #f0f0f0;
    padding: 20px;
}

//This code will change the background color of the header to light gray (#f0f0f0) and add some padding.
